      <h1>Why learn code? 17 benefits of learning code</h1>
    
      <h2>Anyone Can Learn to Code</h2>
      <p>One of the best things about coding is that anyone can learn how to do it. No matter your age, gender, or background, coding is a skill that anyone can pick up.

For a long time, people viewed coding as a skill for math and science geniuses. But that is no longer the case. While it helps to be good at math and have an analytical mindset, you dont need to be a genius to learn to code. As long as you are willing to put in the time and effort, anyone can learn to code.</p>
      
      
          <h2>You can learn to code on your own</h2>
          <p>One of the best things about coding is that all you need is a device and internet connection to pick up the skill. And with the vast resources available online, its easier than ever to get started.

There are plenty of resources that can help you. Naturally, we recommend SitePoint Premiums extensive library of books and courses from publishers like Wiley, A List Apart, and (of course) SitePoint.

With this guide, youll be learning one of the most popular programming languages on Earth and youll be on your way to a coding career.
